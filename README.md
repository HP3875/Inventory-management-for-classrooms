Build a simple App to maintain an inventory of classrooms at Conestoga. This will be accomplished by building a Win Forms app, and some accompanying classes in a class library, in order for the classroom details to be stored in, and retrieved from, a file using a class that encapsulates all the file I/O details. Accordingly, the starting code solution includes 2 projects: a class library project and a WinForms project.
